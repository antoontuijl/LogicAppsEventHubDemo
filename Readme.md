<b>Using managed identities to integrate Azure Event Hubs with Azure Logic Apps involves creating a secure and streamlined way to access and manage resources without requiring explicit credentials. Here’s a high-level guide to set this up:</b>

<b>Step 1: Create an Azure Event Hub</b><br />
	1. Navigate to Azure Portal: Go to the Azure Portal.<br />
	2. Create a new Event Hub namespace: Search for "Event Hubs" and create a new namespace.<br />
	3. Create an Event Hub within the namespace: Inside your newly created namespace, create an Event Hub.<br />
 <br />

<b>Step 2: Set Up Managed Identity for the Logic App</b><br />
	1. Create a Logic App: Go to the Azure Portal and create a new Logic App.<br />
	2. Enable System-Assigned Managed Identity:<br />
		- Open your Logic App in the Azure Portal.<br />
		- Under the "Identity" section, turn on the System-assigned managed identity.<br />
<br />

<b>Step 3: Assign Permissions to the Managed Identity</b><br />
	1. Navigate to the Event Hub namespace: Go to the namespace where your Event Hub is located.<br />
	2. Assign Role:<br />
		- Under the "Access Control (IAM)" section, add a role assignment.<br />
		- Assign the "Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver" or "Azure Event Hubs Data Sender" role (depending on whether your Logic App will be sending or receiving messages) to the managed identity of your Logic App.<br />

<br />

<b>Step 4: Configure the Logic App to Use Managed Identity</b><br />
	1. Open Logic App Designer:<br />
		- In the Logic App designer, add a trigger or action that involves Event Hubs.<br />
		- When prompted to sign in, choose the option to use Managed Identity.<br />
	2. Use Managed Identity in Actions:<br />
		- For example, to send messages to Event Hub, use the "Send event" action.<br />
		- For receiving messages, you can set up an HTTP trigger that processes Event Hub messages.<br />
<br />

<b>Example: Sending Events to Event Hub</b><br />
	1. Add a Trigger: Start with a trigger (e.g., HTTP request, Timer, etc.).<br />
	2. Add an Action:<br />
		- Search for "Event Hubs" in the connector list.<br />
		- Select "Send event" action.<br />
		- Configure the Event Hub details and ensure the connection uses Managed Identity.<br />
<br />

<b>Example: Receiving Events from Event Hub</b><br />
	1. Set Up an HTTP Trigger: This HTTP endpoint can be configured to be the webhook for Event Hubs.<br />
	2. Process Events:<br />
		- Add necessary actions to process incoming events.<br />

<br />

<b>Step-by-Step Configuration</b><br />
	1. Creating an Event Hub:<br />
		- Portal: Home -> Event Hubs -> Add -> Fill in required fields (Namespace, Event Hub name, etc.).<br />
    2. Enabling Managed Identity for Logic App:<br />
		- Portal: Logic Apps -> Select Logic App -> Identity -> System-assigned -> Status: On -> Save.<br />
	3. Assigning Permissions:
		- Portal: Event Hubs Namespace -> Access Control (IAM) -> Add Role Assignment -> Select role (e.g., Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver) -> Assign to Logic App’s managed identity.
	4. Configuring Logic App:
		- Designer: Add Trigger/Action -> Event Hubs -> Use Managed Identity for authentication -> Configure Event Hub details.
